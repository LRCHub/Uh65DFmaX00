Early summer, sunny Sunday
Mum told me my cousin is coming soon today
So I, I ride on my bicycle
Wearing my favorite shirt to meet her at the gate

She is not the sort of girl
Who smiles to say "hello!"
She'll giggle at me
She'll pinch my cheek
Then I think she'll say "hello"

Early summer, sunny Sunday

Wearing my favorite shirt to meet her at the gate

She is not the sort of girl
Who smiles to say "hello!"
She'll giggle at me
She'll pinch my cheek
Then I think she'll say "hello"

Going downhill on the very dusty road
Whistling a merry tune of summer
Going downhill through the very flagrant woods
Whistling a merry tune I never heard before

She is not the sort of girl
Who smiles to say "hello"

She is not the sort of girl
Who smiles to say "hello!"
She'll giggle at me
She'll pinch my cheek
Then I think she'll say "hello"

Whistling a merry tune of summer
Going downhill through the very flagrant woods
Whistling a merry tune I never heard before

She is not the sort of girl
Who smiles to say "hello"
She is not the sort of girl
Who smiles to say "hello"
